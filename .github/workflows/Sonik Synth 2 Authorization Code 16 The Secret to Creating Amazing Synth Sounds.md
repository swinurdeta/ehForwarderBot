Another feature of Sonik Synth 2 is its powerful synthesis engine, which allows you to tweak and shape the sounds to your liking. Sonik Synth 2 offers three different synthesis modes: traditional resampling, pitch-shift/time-stretch, and STRETCH (Sampletank Time REsynthesis TeCHnology). The resampling mode lets you change the pitch and length of the samples without affecting each other. The pitch-shift/time-stretch mode lets you change both parameters independently. The STRETCH mode lets you manipulate the harmonic content and the formants of the samples, creating new timbres and textures.
 
Finally, Sonik Synth 2 also features a comprehensive effects section, which includes 32 high-quality effects such as reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, phaser, distortion, compression, EQ, filter, and more. You can apply up to five effects per part and up to five effects on the master output. You can also use the modulation matrix to assign various parameters to MIDI controllers or LFOs for dynamic expression and control.
